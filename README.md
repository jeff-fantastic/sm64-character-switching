# Super Mario 64 Character Switching Menu

This project is meant to demo the following:
- Implementing objects into the title and fileselect levels
- Loading in custom actor data into these levels
- Character selection screen using character models (very unoptimized implementation at the moment)

I have never seen many people try to implement objects and other complexities into these menus, so I decided to take a crack at it myself. Huge thanks to iProgramInCPP for providing code cleanups and leads that helped develop this. This repo is completely free to use in your projects (as long as credit is given to both Jefftastic and iProgramInCPP) and was made as an experiment to see if these things were even possible (and practical). Building process is the exact same as the regular repo, available at https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64
